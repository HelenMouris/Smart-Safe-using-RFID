# Smart Safe using RFID

## Description
The objective of the project is to make an Access Control System for a safe that
utilizes RFID. The system allows the user to unlock the safe by using his
personal RFID card. When the user tries to access the safe, if he is authorized, the
LED blinks green, the buzzer beeps once indicating success and a servo
motor is used to unlock the safe door. If the user is not authorized, the LED
blinks red and the buzzer beeps twice indicating failure. The system
also supports locking the safe automatically with the servo motor when the door is
closed. This is done using an ultrasonic sensor that measures the distance to the
servo on the door.
